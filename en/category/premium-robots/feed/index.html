As businesses and schools struggle to reopen and stay open as a result of COVID-19, the teams here at UBTECH Robotics are answering the call.</p>
<p>Officially launching at CES 2021 we are unveiling three new product lines including the powerful UV-C disinfection robot system, ADIBOT. The ADIBOT robotic system combines our robotics and AI expertise with UV-C technology that disinfects targeted surfaces and air by deactivating the DNA and RNA of harmful pathogens. There are two models debuting at CES: ADIBOT-S the stationary model and ADIBOT-A the autonomous model. The ADIBOT system both feature 360° radiant light coverage and powerful UV-C disinfection to effectively disinfect 99.9 percent of targeted areas. The ADIBOT robots are available for purchase starting now and will ship in January for ADIBOT-S and May for ADIBOT-A.</p>
<p>Additionally, because our robotic manufacturing and AI foundations were already in place, our ADIBOT robots are a premium robotic solution at tens of thousands of dollars less than other market offerings. Our teams worked quickly to bring a cost-effective solution to the market that would allow for this technology to be utilized by organizations that may not have had access to this type of technology previously like schools, gyms, or doctor’s offices.</p>
<p>We are proud to announce we are currently working with the State of Delaware’s Department of Education to pilot ADIBOT across multiple sites to measure cost efficiency, disinfection rates and maintenance improvements within their establishments.</p>
<p>“The Delaware Department of Education, the Office of Equity and Innovation, is pleased to have the opportunity to partner on a pilot with UBTECH and the Christina School District. This endeavor is using new technology in order to sanitize and disinfect above and beyond the current practices used. This additional technology usage not only helps to further advance safety but goes a long way to provide an additional level of comfort for staff, parents, students, and the community at large. We are grateful for the opportunity to be innovative and look forward to assisting on this project,” said James Simmons, chief equity officer, Delaware Department of Education.</p>

<p>While our ADIBOT robotic disinfections are able to create solutions that address immediate needs, we are also debuting two additional new product lines that continue our efforts to make everyday life easier for people now and in the future.</p>
<p>AMR: Intelligent Logistics Robotic System – AMR ushers in a new era of automation to improve operational efficiency. With a unique modular system, businesses can scale their needs from the entry-level model up to and utilizing extension modules that expand functionality to meet their business needs. The AMR system can adapt to numerous environments and integrate with various applications to help further automate operational needs. The AMR Intelligent Logistics system will be available later this year.<br />
JIMU GO – As creators of the popular, award-winning JIMU Robot line, UBTECH is launching a new, updated modular STEM kit system to continue the mission of preparing all kids for a future in STEM and robotics. UBTECH will release three kits in Q4 2021: Robot Speedster Kit, Music Box Maker Kit, and Mars Rover Kit.<br />
Our AMR and JIMU GO products will be available later in 2021, follow our social and sign up for email notifications to stay in the know about these official launches.</p>
<p>Although CES 2021 may be an unusual, virtual experience this year, we are excited to participate in this showcase and to bring our robotic solutions to the global communities. Stay tuned for more information and please contact us here for more information on any questions to our new product lines.</p>
